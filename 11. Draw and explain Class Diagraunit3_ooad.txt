11. Draw and explain Class Diagram notation including attributes, operations, visibility, and multiplicity
Class Diagram Notation

A class diagram models the static structure of a system.
A class is drawn as a rectangle with three compartments:

-------------------------
|      ClassName        |
-------------------------
| - attributeName: Type |
| + age: int            |
-------------------------
| + operation(): Return |
| # calcSalary(): float |
-------------------------

1. Class Name

Mandatory element.

Appears in the top compartment.

2. Attributes

Represent the state of the class.

Shown in the second compartment.

Syntax
attributeName : Type

3. Operations (Methods)

Represent behavior.

Shown in the third compartment.

Syntax
operationName(parameterList) : ReturnType

4. Signature

Full description of an attribute or method:

Types

Parameters

Return type

5. Visibility Symbols
Symbol	Meaning	Purpose
+	Public	Accessible everywhere
-	Private	Accessible only within class
#	Protected	Accessible in class + subclasses
6. Multiplicity Notation

Shows how many instances of one class relate to another.

Example	Meaning
1..1	One-to-one
1..* or 1..n	One-to-many
*..*	Many-to-many
0..1	Optional association
Example

A Customer can place many Orders
→ Customer 1 --- * Order

12. Steps for modeling the vocabulary, collaborations, and logical database schema using class diagrams
1. Modeling the Vocabulary of the System

Steps:

Identify main concepts (classes) from the problem domain.
Example: Student, Course, Teacher.

Add attributes and operations.

Specify relationships (associations, dependencies, generalizations).

Validate the class diagram to ensure common system terminology is consistent.

Purpose:
→ Captures domain language so all team members use the same meaning.

2. Modeling Simple Collaborations

Steps:

Identify the function or behavior to model.
Example: Enrollment, payment, booking.

For each function, identify:

Classes

Interfaces

Collaborations

Define relationships (associations, dependencies) among classes.

Show how classes interact to perform a task.

Purpose:
→ Shows which classes work together and share responsibilities.

3. Modeling Logical Database Schema

Steps:

Identify persistent classes whose data must be stored long-term.

Mark them as persistent using tagged values.

Add structural details:

Attributes

Associations

Multiplicities

Avoid patterns that may complicate relational design:

Cyclic associations

One-to-one

N-ary associations

Convert classes to tables, attributes to columns.

Purpose:
→ Helps map object model to database schema.

13. What are Object Diagrams? Explain terms, notations, and modeling techniques.
Definition

An Object Diagram shows the instances of classes at a specific point in time.
It is like a “snapshot” of the objects and their relationships.

It represents the static design view or static process view of the system.

Terms and Notations
1. Object Notation

Drawn like class but with:

Underlined name

Format: objectName : ClassName

Example:
john : Student

2. Object Attributes

List attributes with actual values, not types.

john : Student
--------------------
name = "John"
age = 20

3. Links

A link represents an instance of an association between two objects.

Shown as a line between objects.

4. Notes/Constraints

Used to describe assumptions or conditions.

Modeling Techniques for Object Diagrams

Identify the function or scenario to model.
Example: Order being placed, login process.

Identify the participating classes and interfaces.

Create instances (objects) for each class.

Assign values to object attributes.

Draw links between objects to represent relationships.

Validate the diagram to ensure it represents a correct state of the system.

Purpose:
→ Helps in debugging, testing, and understanding object interactions.

14. Explain Advanced Structural Modeling topics: Advanced classes, Interfaces, Types and Roles, Packages.
1. Advanced Classes

Classes are classifiers that contain attributes, operations, and semantics.

They support:

Visibility

Polymorphism

Multiplicity

Advanced relationships

They represent complex or specialized behaviors.

2. Interfaces

A collection of operations without implementation.

Used to define contracts.

A class realizes (implements) an interface.

Useful for abstraction and loose coupling.

3. Types and Roles

Type: Defines a set of attributes and operations (like a lightweight classifier).

Role: Describes how a class behaves in a particular relationship or collaboration.

Example: “Student” plays the role of “Learner” in Course enrollment.

4. Packages

Group related classes, interfaces, diagrams, and sub-packages.

Used for:

Organization

Managing large models

Encapsulation

Supports namespace control.

15. Discuss Advanced Dependency Stereotypes: derive, friend, instantiate, instanceOf, refine, powertype

UML dependency stereotypes add extra meaning to ordinary dependencies.

1. derive

Source is computed from the target.

Example:

Age is derived from BirthDate.

2. friend

Source has special visibility to target’s private members.

Example:

Auditor class can access Bank’s private data.

3. instanceOf

Source object is an instance of the target classifier.

Example:

car1 : Car

4. instantiate

Source creates objects of the target class.

Example:

Bank instantiates Account

Teacher instantiates Student objects

5. powertype

A classifier whose objects are subclasses of another class.

"Class of classes."

Example:

Vehicle → Subclasses: Car, Bike, Bus

Powertype: VehicleType

6. refine

Target is a more detailed version of the source.

Adds more information.

Example:

Course → OnlineCourse

Payment → OnlinePayment
